 co-create a society that is ecologically sound, socially just, and economically viable?

Raised as an international adoptee from Dingyuan, China, I grew up on an organic farm for young adults with disabilities. Through my farm experiences, the earth has taught me to appreciate the vitality of our planet's resources and the fundamental changes needed to preserve our planet.

As a junior studying Environmental Science and Policy and Computer Science, I am deeply passionate about the role of innovative design in sustainable solutions. At Smith College, I have engaged in a breadth of interdisciplinary internships, from the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. I am also passionate about representation in the sustainability field and currently serve as board member of the Alliance for Sustainability and co-chair of the Smith College Science Center for Diversity.

My dream is to continue my environmental journey by working alongside international communities on policy initiatives for sustainable practices. I believe inclusive communications and participatory design are essential for prioritizing local needs and emphasizing dynamic forms of engagement. By seeking first to understand, we can develop initiatives that balance conservation protection with socioeconomic growth.

In my free time, I love to bike long distances, cozy up with a <a href="HelenGlover.github.io/now">good novel,</a> draw <a href="HelenGlover.github.io/portfolio">whimsical illustrations</a>, help out on my family farm, and listen to <a href="HelenGlover.github.io/now">excellent music</a>.
